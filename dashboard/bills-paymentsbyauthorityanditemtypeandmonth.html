        <h1>Payments by authority, item type, and month</h1>
        <p>Payments taken in last year, grouped by authority paid, item type, and month the payment was taken. This data can be useful in seeing what item types are causing payments to be taken. It also includes item authority as well as payment authority so can be used for calculating interlending charges between authorities.</p>
