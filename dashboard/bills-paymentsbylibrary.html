        <h1>Payments by library</h1>
        <p>Payments taken in last year, grouped by library paid and payment type. This shows the amount being taken by each library in payments, but also by the different payment types (e.g. CASH). It will also show, from FORGIVEN and CANCELLED payments, income that isn't been taken for these reasons.</p>
