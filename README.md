# Extranet

Repository for internal extranet.

What it is
----------

LibrariesWest is a consortium of 7 library authorities: Bath and North East Somerset, Bristol, Somerset, South Gloucestershire, Poole, Dorset, and North Somerset.

This repository will not hold the full extranet website, but will hold code for customisations done so that these could be easily applied onto another platform, or if we were moving the extranet.
